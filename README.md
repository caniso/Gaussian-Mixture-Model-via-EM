# Gaussian-Mixture-Model-via-EM

 Brief: 
 In the data set ClassificationData1, there are feature vectors of 
 two different classes. There are 2000 attribute vectors for each class. 
 Assume that the attribute vectors are suitable for the Gauss-mix model.
 Using the following code, the GMM parameters were first calculated by 
 the EM algorithm.
 In this process, the data set is divided into two parts as test and 
 training set.In the training set, the first 1800 were taken from 2000 
 data for both classes.The training was performed with 3600 data and the 
 parameters were calculated for each class. The classification was then 
 carried out. It was tested on 400 data using the parameters calculated 
 by training data and calculated the classification success rate.
